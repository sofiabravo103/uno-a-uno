# README

This is a static website for the company Uno a Uno, located in Venezuela. The site is deployed [here](https://uno-a-uno.herokuapp.com/), and its in spanish. 

This is a ruby on rails project. You may use this code for any purpose if you find it useful.

### How do I get set up? ###

#### Ruby and rvm
Ruby version is `2.2.2` and I recommend [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install). Create a gemset with `2.2.2` as ruby version and then using that gemset run bundle install inside the app root dorectory.

#### Dependencies
Run `bundle install` in the root of the application to download dependencies.
